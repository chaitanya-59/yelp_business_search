# BeerCraft

A coding challenge on [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/) : Android App to search & browse crafted beers </br>

## Features Implemented During Challenge
* Beer data fetched using [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
* Data displayed in a list using RecyclerView.
* Each beer item in the list shows name, style and alcoholic content by volume.
* A simple beer animation is displayed while data is being fetched on the network. [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) is used to display the image.
* Color scheme of the app is designed keeping in mind beer shades.
* Search bar on top uses filteration property on the RecyclerView adapter to filter beer items by name or style. Filteration occurs in real time as search query is typed.
* App works in both portrait & landscape modes.
